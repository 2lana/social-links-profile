## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned elementary of semantic HTML5 markup, CSS custom properties, flexbox, media queries, optimal layout depending on device's screen size, hover and focus states for interactive elements. 
During the development process, there was a problem with understanding links to social network profiles. An attempt to use a BEM did not allow us to make the hover correctly. Links in this case should not be treated as buttons, otherwise there will be a conflict in the css.


```css
.profile-github:hover, a.profile-github:hover {
    cursor: pointer; 
    background-color: var(--green);
    transition: all .1s ease-in-out;
    color: var(--off-black);
    font-weight: 600;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts html, css and Javascript, responsive web design.
